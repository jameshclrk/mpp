## Included Libraries
The code is ready to be compiled on the CP Lab machines as is, however there are two included libraries:
    pgmio
    arralloc
These were the libraries provided on Learn.

## Compilation:
Each implementation should be compiled as follows:

    make clean && make parallel
  or
    make clean && make serial

## Execution:
The parallel code should be executed with:
    mpiexec -n N ./reconstruct.parallel [options] edge_file

The serial code should be executed with:
    ./reconstruct.serial [options] edge_file

## Benchmarking:
The benchmark should be submitted to Morar with:
    qsub -q morar1+2 run.sh

## Validating Output
The sha256-checksum file contains the hashes for all the reconstructed images generated from the edge files in the edge folder after 2500 iterations.
The benchmark will automatically try to validate the output, however manual verification is possible if the output is written as follows:
    mpiexec -n [P] ./reconstruct.parallel edge/edgenew[N]x[M].pgm -o out/[N]x[M]-[P].pgm
  and
    ./reconstruct.serial edge/edgenew[N]x[M].pgm -o out/[N]x[M]-serial.pgm
The output can be verified by running:
    sha256sum -c sha256-checksum

Note if the file does not exist, it will fail the validation.

## Documentation
The documentation can be generated running
   doxygen
and can be found in the resulting doc/ directory
